REST APIs are often described using an OpenAPI definition. This file contains information about operations in an API and how the request and response data for the API should be structured.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

- Create a serverless function project in Visual Studio
- Test function APIs locally using built-in OpenAPI functionality
- Publish project to a function app in Azure with API Management integration
- Get the access key for the function and set it in API Management
- Download the OpenAPI definition file

The serverless function you create provides an API that lets you determine whether an emergency repair on a wind turbine is cost-effective. Because both the function app and API Management instance you create use consumption plans, your cost for completing this tutorial is minimal.
